description: An overview of the Driver Fatigue Detection Benchmark, a multimodal dataset for researching driver safety technologies.

---

Welcome to the **Driver Fatigue Detection Benchmark** repository. This resource is dedicated to advancing the development and testing of driver safety technologies through a comprehensive collection of multimodal data. Utilizing thermal imaging, depth mapping, and visible light cameras, the dataset is uniquely prepared under varied environmental conditions to simulate real-world driving scenarios.

## Data Collection Setup

Data was collected in a controlled environment designed to mimic the driver's seat of a vehicle, featuring:
- **Three distinct camera types**: visible light, thermal, and depth map cameras.
- **Simulated driving environment**: Equipped with five monitors to display various driving scenarios.
- **Multi-spectral data capture**: Simultaneous recording from all three camera types to capture a wide range of data points.

## Data Characteristics

The dataset includes:
- **44 subjects** from diverse demographics, including different genders, ages, and varying physical features such as glasses and beards.
- **Multi-spectral recordings**: Each subject was recorded simultaneously by all three cameras, providing a comprehensive set of data across different imaging modalities.
- **Varied data scenarios**: Subjects performed a series of predefined actions to simulate different levels of driver fatigue.
  - **Yawning without Covering Mouth**: Videos capturing subjects yawning openly, which is a common sign of tiredness.
  - **Yawning with Mouth Covered**: This class includes videos where subjects cover their mouths while yawning, often considered a social behavior to mask tiredness.
  - **Eye Rubbing**: Subjects are shown rubbing their eyes, a behavior typically associated with fatigue and eye strain.
  - **Head Dropping**: This category features subjects whose heads drop in a nodding motion, indicating severe drowsiness or loss of alertness.
  - **Frequent Blinking**: Recordings of subjects blinking more frequently than usual, which can indicate the early stages of fatigue.

Each class is designed to represent specific fatigue-related behaviors. The variety in recorded actions allows researchers to train more robust models that can detect a wide range of fatigue signs under various conditions.

## Scenario Description

Participants were asked to engage in a sequence of actions mimicking driver fatigue, which includes:
1. **Basic Driving Simulation**: Engaging in normal driving activities with occasional blinking.
2. **Induced Fatigue Symptoms**: Performing actions such as frequent eye blinks, eye rubbing, yawning, and head movements.
3. **Transition to Severe Fatigue**: Simulating severe fatigue symptoms like yawning with hand gestures and aggressive head shaking.

These structured scenarios ensure the dataset captures both subtle and pronounced signs of driver fatigue.
