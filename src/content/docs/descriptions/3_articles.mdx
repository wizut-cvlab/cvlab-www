## Multispectral Data Acquisition in the Assessment of Driver's Fatigue
Authors: Małecki, K., Nowosielski, A., Forczmański, P.  
_Published in: Smart Solutions in Today's Transport, Springer, 2017, pp. 320-332_

Many factors contribute to road accidents, with driver behavior and fatigue being the most significant. This paper presents characteristics of selected multispectral data (visual image, depth map, thermal image) used for automatic assessment of driver fatigue. A simulator station, mimicking a driver’s cabin and equipped with various video sensors and monitors showing real driving situations, was developed for data acquisition.

## Eyes State Detection in Thermal Imaging
Authors: Forczmański, P., Smoliński, A.  
_Published in: Image Processing and Communications, Springer, 2020, pp. 22-29_

This paper discusses the analysis of facial areas captured in thermal spectrum to estimate the drowsiness of observed persons. The state of eyes is considered crucial, and a Gabor filtering-based approach is applied to classify the eyes' state. This approach allows for capturing eye states in adverse lighting conditions, showing promising results in simulated cabin environments.

## Pedestrian Detection in Severe Lighting Conditions: Comparative Study of Human Performance vs Thermal-Imaging-Based Automatic System
Authors: Nowosielski, A., Małecki, K., Forczmański, P., Smoliński, A.  
_Published in: Progress in Computer Recognition Systems, Springer, 2020, pp. 174-183_

This paper discusses the problem of detecting human bodies in severe lighting conditions from the driver's perspective. It presents the results of a study on threat situation recognition, defined as the sudden appearance of a pedestrian in the driver's field of view. The efficiency of human reaction and delay time are contrasted with an automatic detection system based on thermal imagery.
