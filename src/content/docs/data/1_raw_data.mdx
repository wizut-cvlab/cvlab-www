Explore and download the raw data files from our Driver Fatigue Detection dataset. These files are provided in ZIP format, each containing different modalities of data collected during our studies. **Please note that the data is raw and unprocessed.**

## Depth Data
**File Description:** This ZIP file contains depth map videos and point cloud data files captured during the experiments.

  <Card title="Contents">
    - Number of Video Files: 110
    - Files: Depth maps and Point Cloud Data
    - Format: Videos (.mkv)
    - Total File Size: **2.5GB**
  </Card>
