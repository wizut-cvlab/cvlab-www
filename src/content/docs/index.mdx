## What We Offer

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Explore Modalities" icon="puzzle">
		Learn about the different modalities we use: visual image, depth map, and thermal image to capture comprehensive data.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Understand Recorded Events" icon="random">
		Discover the specific behaviors we record, including yawning, eye rubbing, and head dropping to detect driver fatigue.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Uniform Measuring Stand" icon="seti:happenings">
		All records were made under identical lighting and position conditions. Our stand is designed for multispectral data acquisition to assess driver's fatigue, featuring five monitors, a steering wheel, and three different cameras.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Download Data" icon="seti:argdown">
		Access both raw and processed data, ready for your research and development in fatigue detection algorithms. Explore raw multimodal data or download uniform and processed clips for further analysis.
